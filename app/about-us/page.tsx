                {SITE_NAME} is an independent guide site for {GAME_NAME}, the parking jam puzzle game by {GAME_DEVELOPER}. We organize walkthrough videos, level solutions, and strategy notes so players can clear bus traffic without wasting moves.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Our goal is to help players understand the route logic behind each move: which bus blocks the exit, which lane should stay open, and how passenger flow changes the solution.
